# NBA-Player-Stat-Evaluation

Project Description:
Goal: To create a database of NBA players and assigning points to each player based on their stats.
The database will include all the information about the players, player stats, teams, matches, coaches and stadium location. Based on the player stats, we will be assigning points to each player which will help us get an idea about the player’s overall performance compared to other players.

Strategy:
We are planning to web scrape the NBA’s website to extract data and use the player stat to create logic for Player Points. As we have 2 members in the group, we will be diving the web scraping and the logic building for parts accordingly. Using this data, we will create the database for our system.

Outcome:
A solidified asset vault as a data set that is freely accessible on GitHub. This will be a guide for how to utilize the data set and a definite walkthrough toward the undertaking's end.
